The distribution rights for the three Monty Python games were acquired by Panasonic Interactive Media the next day, ending 7th Level's involvement with game development and publishing. The announced merger between 7th Level and Pulse Entertainment was later canceled in April of the following year. Before ceasing all game development, 7th Level had begun working on another title, named Dominion: Storm Over Gift 3. The partially completed game was sold to Ion Storm to finish development."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Mail>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Royal Mail is the government-owned postal service in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Royal Mail Holdings plc owns Royal Mail Group Limited, which in turn operates the brands Royal Mail (letters) and Parcelforce Worldwide (parcels). Post Office Ltd. (counters) and General Logistics Systems, an international logistics company, are wholly owned subsidiaries. Royal Mail Holdings is a public limited company in which the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills owns 50,004 ordinary shares plus 1 special share, and the Treasury Solicitor holds 1 ordinary share. Historically, the General Post Office was a government department which included the Royal Mail delivery business, represented in Her Majesty's Government by the Postmaster General, a Cabinet-level post. It became a statutory corporation known as the Post Office in 1969. Most of the duties were passed to Consignia plc, a public limited company wholly owned by Her Majesty's Government, in November 2001 and the dormant Post Office Corporation was dissolved in 2007. Consignia changed to Consignia Holdings plc, then Royal Mail Holdings plc, the current name. Royal Mail was not privatised in the 1980s or 1990s, and currently remains a state-owned company. However the Postal Services Act 2011 enables the government to privatise up to 90% of Royal Mail, with 10% being held by Royal Mail employees. The first sale of shares is expected in late 2013 or early 2014. The Act makes provision for Post Office Ltd. to continue to be owned by the Crown or a mutual ownership structure. Royal Mail is responsible for universal mail collection and delivery in the UK. Letters are deposited in a pillar or wall box, taken to a post office, or collected in bulk from businesses. Deliveries are made at least once every day except Sundays and Bank Holidays at uniform charges for all British destinations. First Class deliveries are generally made the next business day throughout the nation. In 2006, Royal Mail delivered 84\u00A0million items every working day and had a network of 14,376 post offices with a revenue of \u00A39.056\u00A0billion, and profits before tax were \u00A3312\u00A0million. Since that time, profits have dropped year on year \u2013 \u00A3233\u00A0million in 2006-7 falling to a \u00A310\u00A0million trading deficit in 2007. In 2008, the BBC reported that Royal Mail's trading position had worsened to an annual loss of \u00A3279\u00A0million/yr in financial 2007. For the financial year 2008-9 Royal Mail had an operating profit of \u00A3321m, with all four group businesses in a full year profit for the first time in two decades. In Wales, the service carries the Welsh name Post Brenhinol, as well as the English name. Both names are normally used on vans, postboxes etc. It is also compulsory for all Post Offices in Wales to have the name Swyddfa'r Post on display outside. Post Offices in Gaelic-speaking areas of Scotland, such as the Hebrides and parts of the Highlands, also display the name Oifis a'\u00A0Phuist (\"Post Office\")."@en .

The airline began operations in 1964 as a subsidiary of Central African Airways, and after the latter's dissolution, it became independent and the national airline of Malawi. Since its inception, the airline has concentrated on domestic and regional flights, with the exception of a short-lived long-haul flight to London in the 1970s. Air Malawi has frequently had financial difficulties, and the Malawian government has attempted to privatise the airline on two occasions without success. The first attempt in 2003 failed because the successful bidder, in partnership with South African Airways, was unable to post a security bond. The second attempt in 2007 failed after disagreements over the terms with the bidder, Comair of South Africa. The government, through its agent the Privatisation Commission, announced in September 2012 that it had embarked on another search to identify a competent strategic equity partner for Air Malawi. From its main base at Chileka International Airport, Blantyre, Air Malawi currently operates two aircraft on a route network with five other destinations: Lilongwe, Johannesburg, Harare, Dar es Salaam and Lusaka."@en .

Before its merger with Air France, the airline was headquartered in Paray-Vieille-Poste, Essonne. Earlier in its life, it was headquartered in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. Air Inter was incorporated on 12 November 1954. It operated its first commercial flight between Paris and Strasbourg on 16 March 1958. However, it was 1960 when the airline started regular commercial services. The company established its operational and engineering base at Paris-Orly Airport, where its flights were concentrated at Orly Ouest, Orly Airport's West Terminal. Air Inter was founded as a semi-public entity to provide efficient domestic air transport at the lowest cost. Its financial backers included French public and private sector transport businesses in road, rail and air transport, as well as banks. Air France and Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer Fran\u00E7ais (SNCF), the state railway company, were Air Inter's two largest public sector shareholders, each holding 25% in the airline. Union des Transports A\u00E9riens (UTA) was its largest private sector investor. UTA initially held a 15% minority stake in Air Inter. UTA subsequently increased its shareholding to 36%, becoming the largest single shareholder. On 12 January 1990 Air Inter, with UTA and Air France, became part of an enlarged Air France group, which in turn became a subsidiary of Groupe Air France. Air Inter changed to Air France Europe following a merger with Air France and UTA. On 1 April 1997, it was absorbed into Air France. On that day, the firm ceased to exist as a legal entity within Groupe Air France."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seznam.cz>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Seznam. cz (or just Seznam, which means list in English) is a web portal and search engine in the Czech Republic. Founded in 1996 by Ivo Luka\u010Dovi\u010D in Prague as the first web portal in the Czech Republic. Seznam started with a search engine and an internet version of yellow pages. Today, Seznam runs more than 15 different web services and associated brands. Seznam had more than 4 million exclusive visitors per month at the end of 2008. Among the most popular services, according to NetMonitor, are Seznam homepage, Seznam Email, Seznam Search and Seznam yellow pages. In the Czech market, Seznam. cz was until 2008 in competition with the portals Centrum. cz and Atlas. cz. These two portals, despite merging in 2008, no longer appear likely to overcome Seznam in the near future. Seznam's biggest competitor now appears to be global Google, especially in the area of full-text search. As of May 2012, according to Toplist results, Seznam is the second internet search engine in the Czech Republic (42.84%) with Google in the top spot (54.69%). Seznam, like four other companies in the world, was for a long time the number one search engine in its region. Other such search engines are Baidu, Naver, Yahoo Japan and Yandex. Since 2011, Seznam has used as its slogan a Czech rhyme Seznam - najdu tam, co hled\u00E1m (Seznam - I find there, what I search for). Prior to this its slogan was Seznam - najdu tam, co nezn\u00E1m (Seznam - I find there, what I don't know)."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vostok_watches>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Vostok (Russian: \u0412\u043E\u0441\u0442\u043E\u043A, meaning East*) Watch Makers, Inc. produces mainly rugged military and diver mechanical watches at its factory in Chistopol, Tatarstan, Russia. It also makes clocks and watch movements for other watch brands. The Vostok Company was founded in 1942 when one of the Moscow watch-making plants of the First Moscow Watch Factory was evacuated to Chistopol, a small town located on the Kama River in Tatarstan. Only defense equipment was produced during the war years, but as soon as the war was over the company started making mechanical wrist watches. However, the Company did not begin using the \"Vostok\" brand name until the 1960s. *Presumable \"Vostok\" brand was named after the Vostok space program, which gave the initial advancement of the USSR in the Space race (as some others soviet watch brands, named to space topics in 1960s - Poljot and Raketa). The company was appointed an official supplier of watches for the Defense Department of the Soviet Union in 1965. This year also marks the creation of the well known Komandirskie (\"Commander's\") watch. (See photo, below left. ) The experience gained through development of the army watch led to the Amphibia, a stainless-steel watch able to withstand a 200 meter depth (20atm). By 1980, Vostok Watch Makers was producing 4.5 million timepieces per year. Watches sold to the military were marked \"\u0417\u0410\u041A\u0410\u0417 \u041C\u041E \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420,\" meaning \"By Order of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR. \" These models were sold exclusively through Voentorg stores, which catered to military personnel with identification only. (Today, these models have become sought-after collectibles. ) At turn of the 21st century, Vostok launched a line of 1940s-style replicas called the Kirovskie K-43 collection. Vostok also began producing a \"luxury\" line of watches called Kremlevskie. Both lines are made of stainless steel, produced in limited quantities, and aimed toward a more affluent consumer. In 2004, Vostok Watch Makers began supplying movements to the Koliz Company of Lithuania, makers of the Vostok Europe brand of timepieces. In 2006, Vostok Watch Makers began marketing another new line of watches branded \"Amfibia. \" This brand, like most other Vostok products, features the familiar 31-jewel automatic (No. 2416B) movement. These watches feature \"diver\" styling with polyurethane or stainless steel bands. An updated version of the Komandirskie debuted in summer, 2007, and a special anniversary edition of the Amphibia (called the \"1967\") appeared in early 2008. Both of these models feature high-quality assembly, materials and packaging. Despite the introduction of the new lines of Komandirskie and Amphibia, the \"classic\" models (mostly designed in 1960s and 1970s) of these lines was still in production (as of 2012). In early 2010, Vostok Watch Factory filed for bankruptcy and their official web page was disabled. Despite that, the production didn't stop and the factory is still working and supplying watches and movements (as of 2012)."@en .

Vatican Bank was also accused of funneling covert United States funds to Solidarity and the Contras through Banco Ambrosiano."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bloomberg_L.P.>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Bloomberg L.P. is a multinational mass media corporation based in New York City. Bloomberg makes up one third of the $16 billion global financial data market, with estimated revenue of $7.6 billion in 2011. Bloomberg L.P. was founded by Michael R. Bloomberg with the help of Thomas Secunda, Duncan MacMillan, and Charles Zegar in 1981 and a 30% ownership investment by Merrill Lynch. The company provides financial software tools such as analytics and equity trading platform, data services and news to financial companies and organizations around the world through the Bloomberg Terminal (via its Bloomberg Professional Service), its core money-generating product. Many customers use only a small fraction of the machine's 30,146 functions. Bloomberg L.P. has grown to include a global news service, including television, radio, the Internet and printed publications. Its current headquarters are located at the Bloomberg Tower, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The building is also known as One Beacon Court for the lighted rectangular beacon that caps the tower and the paved courtyard at the ground level. Bloomberg L.P. was formed as a Delaware Limited Partnership in 1981 and has been in business since 1983. Michael Bloomberg owns 88% of the partnership. Bloomberg's core business is leasing terminals to subscribers. It also runs Bloomberg Television, a financial television network, and the business radio station WBBR in New York City. There are currently over 300,000 Bloomberg Terminal subscribers worldwide. Its competitors include SNL Financial, Interactive Data Corporation, Thomson Reuters, S&P Capital IQ, Dow Jones Newswires, FactSet, Dealogic, and smaller companies such as New York Financial Press. In late 1996 Bloomberg bought back one-third of Merrill Lynch's 30 percent stake in his company for $200 million valuing the company at $2 billion. In July 2008, Merrill Lynch agreed to sell its 20% stake in the firm back to Bloomberg, for a reported $4.43 billion, valuing the firm at approximately $22.5 billion."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/CodeWeavers>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"CodeWeavers is a company that sells a proprietary version of Wine called CrossOver, for running Windows applications on Mac OS X and Linux. The company was founded in 1996 as a consultancy, eventually moving entirely over to Wine development and support. The CrossOver version of Wine is regularly refreshed with the latest free Wine patches; likewise, patches from the company are sent back to the Wine project almost immediately. This distinguishes the company from TransGaming, which develops a forked version of Wine called Cedega, and no longer returns contributions to free Wine. CodeWeavers is a major contributor to the Wine project, a free software / open-source software project that helps Windows applications run on different x86-based operating systems, and employs the project's maintainer, Alexandre Julliard, as their CTO. The Company's products include CrossOver Linux and CrossOver Mac. Both programs include now the functionality of both the CrossOver Games and CrossOver Pro lines therefore CrossOver Games and CrossOver Server are no longer available as single products. The company's products have traditionally focused on making Microsoft software staples like Microsoft Office, MS Word, and MS Excel run on Linux. With the addition of CrossOver Pro Mac the company has also begun focusing on games and other applications not available natively on the Mac platform, such as MS Visio and MS Project. CrossOver Games was introduced in March 2008 and was intended to allow gaming-related patches from Wine to be incorporated into CrossOver much faster. The CrossOver Pro product line focused on stability and in-depth testing with supported productivity software, such as Microsoft Office, and had a slower release cycle. CodeWeavers also provides implementation and consulting services around Wine and other open-source software projects. Google has paid CodeWeavers to improve support for Adobe Photoshop and add functionality to Wine. CodeWeavers is also a founding member of the Desktop Linux Consortium."@en .

Today, it is the largest Finnish hamburger restaurant chain, with a larger presence in the Finnish market than U.S. -based McDonald's. With only 12 outlets in 1992, Hesburger expanded to over 200 restaurants in 60 towns across Finland over the following decade, absorbing rival chain Carrols in 2002. Hesburger has also expanded to international markets, opening outlets in the Baltic states and Germany. There was a Hesburger in Damascus, Syria for a short period between 2004 and 2006, but it was closed as unprofitable. Hesburger has about 260 restaurants in Finland, 31 in Latvia, 29 in Estonia, 29 in Lithuania, four in Germany, eight in Russia and one in Ukraine. Hesburger continues with attempts to penetrate the Middle East markets, via contracts with local companies. The company name comes from the nickname of the founder, Heikki \"Hese\" Salmela. The chain's history reaches back to 1966, when Heikki Salmela (born 1946) opened a street food kiosk in Naantali. He later opened the first Hesburger in 1980 in Turku, which became the first element of the first fast food restaurant chain in Finland. In the 1980s the chain grew fast. Salmela sold the chain and several hotels in 1988 for almost 200 million Finnish markkas. Three years later, during the recession, he bought it back for 25 million. Many Hesburger restaurants offer WiFi coverage, and some use RFID and other real-time commerce technologies to serve the customers. There is also a Hesburger Hotel located in Finland's third largest urban centre, Turku. This Hesburger hotel has a 24 hour Hesburger restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel, which is also the reception of the hotel when checking in. The rooms of the hotel also offer free internet access. Hesburger primarily sells hamburgers, cheeseburgers, salads, french fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. Hesburger also have kebab restaurants (which offer a kebab menu in addition to the normal one) and pasta restaurants (which offer a pasta menu in addition to the normal one), Hesecafes, hot dog outlets, and restaurants which also offer carwash services to their customers.

Perhaps the most famous use of the Hasselblad camera was during the Apollo program missions when man first landed on the Moon. Almost all of the still photographs taken during these missions used modified Hasselblad cameras. Hasselblad's traditional V-System cameras remain widely used by professional and serious amateur photographers. One reason is a reputation for long service life and quality of available lenses. Their newer H-System cameras are market leaders, competing with Sinar, Mamiya and others in the medium format digital camera market."@en .

The current owner is Lynsi Torres, the only grandchild of founders Harry and Esther Snyder. As of February 2013, In-N-Out employed 18,000 and had 281 locations with no location more than one day's drive from a regional distribution center. As the chain has expanded, it has opened several distribution centers in addition to its original Baldwin Park location. Located in Phoenix, Arizona; Draper, Utah; and Dallas, Texas; these new distribution centers will provide for potential future expansion into other parts of the country. In-N-Out Burger has resisted franchising its operations or going public; one reason is the prospect of quality or customer consistency being compromised by excessively rapid business growth. The company's business practices have been noted for employee-centered personnel policies. For example, In-N-Out is one of the few fast food chains in the United States to pay its employees significantly more than state and federally mandated minimum wage guidelines \u2013 starting at US$10 per hour in California, as of January 2008. The In-N-Out restaurant chain has developed a highly loyal customer base, and has been rated as one of the top fast food restaurants in several customer satisfaction surveys."@en .

Since its foundation in 1976 by 10 independent Danish haulers, the company has achieved rapid expansion and international presence, predominantly through a series of strategic competitor acquisitions, the most important being Samson Transport (1997), DFDS Dan Transport (2000), Bachmann (2004), Frans Maas (2006) and ABX Logistics (2008). With headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, and offices in more than 60 countries, DSV employs approximately 21,000 people and collaborating with partners and agents worldwide. DSV is listed on NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen and included in the OMXC20 index as one of the 20 most traded stocks. The company is structured in three divisions, DSV Road, DSV Air & Sea and DSV Solutions. Its biggest activity lies within the European road transport (trucking) network, followed by its air and sea freight forwarding business. The group also has a growing pan-European contract logistics business. As part of an asset-light financial strategy to maintain fixed costs at a minimum and be able to quickly respond to market fluctuations, DSV does not own any ships or aeroplanes and only a small number of trucks and trailers. Jens Bj\u00F8rn Andersen became CEO in August 2008. In 2009 DSV turned over Euro 4,844 million and realised pre-tax profits of Euro 61.8 million."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jura_Elektroapparate>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Jura Elektroapparate AG is a Swiss developer and distributor of home appliances, headquartered in Niederbuchsiten, Canton of Solothurn. The company was founded in 1931 by Leo Henzirohs. Formerly, Jura ran its own factory, but outsourced production to outside companies in the 1990s. Jura is currently best known for its fully automatic espresso machines. This core area originated in the early 1980s and is nowadays a main element of the brand image as well as creating most of its sales. A strong focus is laid on design and there are no low-budget machines. The espresso machines are produced by Eugster/Frismag in Romanshorn, which company also manufactures machines for other brands such as Siemens, Bosch and AEG. Jura used to be well known as a producer of other home appliances too, especially clothes irons. At the end of 2008, Jura has generally ceased distributing its ironing product range, except in its home market of Switzerland where they still offer a limited range of \"classic\" products such as irons, a toaster in retro style, and a pretzel iron. The automatic espresso machines are distributed worldwide. In Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, France, Sweden, Spain, the United Kingdom, the USA and in Australia Jura has its own distribution companies or joint ventures. This is also the case for Central Eastern Europe. Jura's brand ambassador is Roger Federer. In 2006, Jura inaugurated the visitor's centre \u201EJURAworld of Coffee\u201C at the Niederbuchsiten headquarters."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canada_Post>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Canada Post Corporation, known more simply as Canada Post (French: Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 canadienne des postes, or simply Postes Canada), is the Canadian crown corporation which functions as the country's primary postal operator. Royal Mail Canada, the operating name of the Post Office Department of the Canadian government, was founded in 1867. It was then rebranded as \u201CCanada Post\u201D in the late 1960s, even though it had not yet been separated from the government. On October 16, 1981, the Canada Post Corporation Act came into force. This abolished the Post Office Department and created the present day Crown corporation which provides post service, the Canada Post Corporation. The act purported to set a new direction for the postal service, aiming to create a more reliable service and to ensure the postal service's financial security and independence. Every business day, Canada Post provides service to 14.8 million addresses, delivering 45 million items. Delivery takes place via traditional \"to the door\" service by 15,000 letter carriers, supplemented by a 7,000 vehicle fleet in rural and suburban areas, and truck delivery of parcels. There are 6,500 post offices across the country, a combination of corporate offices and dealerships that are operated by private retailers in conjunction with a host retail business, such as a drugstore. In terms of area serviced, Canada Post delivers to a larger area than the postal service of any other nation, including Russia (where service in Siberia is limited largely to communities along the railway). As of 2004, nearly 843,000 rural Canadian customers received residential mail delivery services. On a consolidated basis, the Corporation processed 10.8 billion pieces during year 2009. Consolidated revenue from operations reached $7.3 billion and consolidated net income totaled $281 million. To compete effectively, Canada Post operates as a group of companies called The Canada Post Group. It employs 71,000 full and part-time employees to deliver a full range of delivery, logistics and fulfillment services to customers. The Corporation holds an interest in Purolator Courier, Innovapost, Progistix-Solutions and Canada Post International Limited. In 2000, Canada Post created a company called Epost, allowed customers to receive their bill online for free (in 2007, Epost was absorbed into Canada Post). Canada Post is the Federal Identity Program name. The legal name is Canada Post Corporation in English and Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 canadienne des postes in French. During the late 1980s and much of the 1990s, the short forms used in the corporation's logo were \"Mail\" (English) and \"Poste\" (French), rendered as \"Mail Poste\" in English Canada, and \"Poste Mail\" in Quebec, although English-language advertising also still referred to the corporation as \"Canada Post\"."@en .

Continental is based in Hanover, Lower Saxony, Germany. Continental is the world's 4th largest tire manufacturer after Bridgestone, Michelin, and Goodyear. Continental was founded in 1871 as a rubber manufacturer, Continental-Caoutchouc und Gutta-Percha Compagnie. After acquiring Siemens AG's VDO automotive unit in 2007 Continental was ranked fourth in global OEM automotive parts sales in 2009 according to a study sponsored by Ernst & Young LLP. In 2008, Continental appeared overextended with its integration of VDO and had since lost almost half of its market capitalization when it found itself to be the takeover target of the family-owned Schaeffler AG. By 2009 Schaeffler successfully installed the head of its motor division at the helm of Continental. On 6 September 2012, Continental returned to the benchmark DAX index of 30 selected German blue chip stocks after a 45-month absence. Schaeffler AG is the controlling shareholder and currently owns 49.9% of Continental shares."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mozambique_Company>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"The Mozambique Company was a royal company operating in Portuguese Mozambique that had the concession of the lands in the Portuguese colony corresponding to the present provinces of Manica and Sofala in central Mozambique. The company was established in February 1891 with a capital stock of about 5 million dollars obtained from financiers from Germany, the United Kingdom and South Africa. Isaacman and Isaacman report that the firm was capitalised at 40,000 pounds (not $5 M), and that British and French capital quickly predominated. The concession was granted for a period of 50 years, during which the company could not only exploit the resources and existing manpower (partly through the chibalo system of forced labour) but also grant subconcessions. The company was granted the exclusive right to collect taxes, but was itself granted a 25-year tax exemption. In return the Portuguese state would receive 7.5% of the company's profits and 10% of the sold shares. The company was also required to settle 1,000 Portuguese families and provide education and public administration in its territory. In practice, the company made only partial use of the prerogatives with which it had been bestowed; but this was balanced by the fact that it also met very few of its obligations. Having only limited capital, the company did little to develop the area, deriving most of its income from its ability to tax and its power to use conscripted labour on its plantations and for lease to adjacent estates. Resistance to the forced labour regime was a major cause of rebellions against the company which occurred in 1902 and 1917. Despite the company's obligation under its charter to provide forces to maintain law and order, it was unable to meet these crises, and on both occasions Portugal had to mount expensive interventions. The Mozambique Company had its headquarters in Beira, where it controlled the public administration and the post offices. The company also founded a private bank, the Banco da Beira, which issued currency in pounds. Because of its bad performance and because of the shift, under the Salazar regime, towards Portuguese control and away from international control of the economy, the company's concession was not renewed when it ran out in 1942. The Governor of Manica and Sofala commented: They did nothing to develop the potential wealth of this entire region, preferring to plunder it and alienate the natives. On July 18, 1942, the territory of Manica and Sofala passed to the Portuguese colonial authorities and the Mozambique Company continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors. On October 20, 1961, The Mozambique Company became the Grupo Entreposto Comercial de Mo\u00E7ambique, which transformed itself into a holding on September 6, 1972, with the participation of capital from other companies, like Entreposto-Gest\u00E3o e Participa\u00E7\u00F5es (SGPS) SA. In 1939 the President of Portugal awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Colonial Empire to the company, the first time it had been awarded to a company."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alfa_Romeo>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. , sometimes colloquially referred to as simply Alfa, is an Italian manufacturer of cars. Founded as A.L.F.A. (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili) on June 24, 1910, in Milan, the company has been involved in car racing since 1911, and has a reputation for building expensive sports cars. The company was owned by Italian state holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale between 1932 and 1986, when it became a part of the Fiat Group, and since February 2007 a part of Fiat Group Automobiles S.p.A. The company that became Alfa Romeo was founded as Societ\u00E0 Anonima Italiana Darracq (SAID) in 1906 by the French automobile firm of Alexandre Darracq, with some Italian investors. In the late 1909, the Italian Darracq cars were selling slowly and a new company was founded named A.L.F.A. (Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili, English: Lombard Automobile Factory, Public Company), initially still in partnership with Darracq. The first non-Darracq car produced by the company was the 1910 24 HP, designed by Giuseppe Merosi. A.L.F.A. ventured into motor racing, with drivers Franchini and Ronzoni competing in the 1911 Targa Florio with two 24 HP models. In August 1915 the company came under the direction of Neapolitan entrepreneur Nicola Romeo, who converted the factory to produce military hardware for the Italian and Allied war efforts. In 1920, the name of the company was changed to Alfa Romeo with the Torpedo 20-30 HP becoming the first car to be badged as such. In 1928 Nicola Romeo left, with Alfa going broke after defense contracts ended, and at the end of 1932 Alfa Romeo was rescued by Benito Mussolini's government, which then had effective control. The Alfa factory struggled to return to profitability after the Second World War, and turned to mass-producing small vehicles rather than hand-building luxury models. In 1954 the company developed the classic Alfa Romeo Twin Cam engine, which would remain in production until 1998. During the 1960s and 1970s Alfa Romeo produced a number of sporty cars, though the Italian government parent company, Finmeccanica, struggled to make a profit so sold the marque to the Fiat Group in 1986. Alfa Romeo has competed successfully in many different categories of motorsport, including Grand Prix motor racing, Formula One, sportscar racing, touring car racing and rallies. They have competed both as a constructor and an engine supplier, via works entries and private entries. The first racing car was made in 1913, three years after the foundation of the company, and Alfa Romeo won the inaugural world championship for Grand Prix cars in 1925. The company gained a good name in motorsport, which gave a sporty image to the whole marque. Enzo Ferrari founded the Scuderia Ferrari racing team in 1929 as an Alfa Romeo racing team, before becoming independent in 1939."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air_Europe>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Air Europe was a wholly privately owned, independent British airline, established in 1978 under the working title Inter European Airways. It adopted the Air Europe name the following year. Its head office was originally in Reigate, Surrey but moved to Crawley, West Sussex. Its main operating base was at London Gatwick Airport, where it commenced commercial airline operations in May 1979 with three brand-new Boeing 737-200 Advanced jet aircraft. Air Europe was the brainchild of Errol Cossey and Martin O'Regan, two former Dan-Air executives. Harry Goodman, who had founded Intasun Leisure during the early 1970s, became the airline's main financial backer as well as the chairman of the International Leisure Group (ILG), the parent company of both Air Europe and Intasun Leisure. Air Europe was the main supplier of charter seats to Intasun Leisure, which grew during the 1980s to become the UK's second-largest package tour operator (after long-established market leader Thomson Holidays). Air Europe aggressively expanded during the 1980s to become one of the UK's leading charter airlines with a major scheduled presence on a number of short-haul European trunk routes out of Gatwick. Towards the end of the 1980s Air Europe became the first airline to acquire a pan-European presence by setting up several subsidiaries on the Continent. Air Europe also acquired two small regional airlines, forming the nucleus of a new Air Europe Express regional airline subsidiary. The acquired slots at Gatwick enabled it to increase frequencies as well as launch new scheduled routes. By the end of the decade Air Europe had become Gatwick's largest resident airline operator. Air Europe's stellar success came to an end when growing financial problems at its parent company began to undermine the financial performance of the airline and its sister companies from late 1989. ILG and all its UK-based subsidiaries \u2014 including Air Europe \u2014 went bankrupt on March 8, 1991."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnetic_Fields_(video_game_developer)>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Magnetic Fields (computer game developer) was a British game development company founded by Shaun Southern and Andrew Morris in February 1982. The company was originally named \"Mr Chip Software\" but renamed \"Magnetic Fields (Software Design) Ltd. \" usually simply referred to as \"Magnetic Fields\", in 1988. Between 1982 and 1984 they released the developed games themselves with limited success. In 1984 they ceased publishing games themselves and instead developed for Publishers Mastertronic and then later for Alternative Software, Gremlin Graphics and other publishers. Probably the best known game released under the Mr. Chip Software company name was Trailblazer which led to several sequels and ports to other systems. Most of the other games released under the Mr. Chip Software label were already focused on racing like Kikstart 2, but also some non-racing games found a fanbase like P.O.D.. Although early development was focused on the Commodore 64 and Commodore VIC-20 platforms the company widened the number of target platforms for their games in the mid 1980s. One of the other platforms included the Commodore 16, which featured a few conversions (including an impressive conversion of Trailblazer), but also a number of unique titles including Arthur Noid and Bandits and Zero. Shaun also wrote a completely different version of Kikstart for the machine to what was produced for the C64. With the switch to the \"Magnetic Fields\" name the company also switched from 8-Bit systems to the rather new 16-Bit systems, with their last 8-bit release being Super Scramble Simulator (a sort of silent 3rd game in the Kikstart series). While developing games belonging to many different genres, Magnetic Fields soon focussed on racing games. The 1985 release of \"Formula 1 Simulator\" was already technically on par with the competing racing games of that time. The company became well known in 1990 for their releases of Super Cars and Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge on most common home computer systems of the time. Especially the strong sales on the Amiga 500 and Atari ST platforms led to sequels in 1991. All three Lotus titles had the nice additional touch of including hidden games in them, with the sequel containing Shaun's classic Duck Shoot game from the Vic 20. In 1996 the company released Network Q RAC Rally Championship for the MS-DOS platform which received many favourable reviews and led to several expansions and sequels, including the X-Miles and International Rally Championship. The last release of the company was Mobil 1 Rally Championship for Windows and PlayStation platforms in 1999. In 2000 Shaun Southern and Andrew Morris founded a new company called \"Eugenicy\" to develop more racing games but the company was closed down before anything was ever released. Andrew Morris released the original promotional trailer for Eugenicy on his YouTube channel in 2009. The company has agreed to let fans distribute their releases for 8-Bit systems as long as no profit is made from these. This has led to additional interest in the company among users of emulators for such older hardware. Kikstart I and II were released in 2010 for the Commodore 64 emulator on the iPhone."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Land_Rover>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Land Rover is a British car manufacturer with its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, United Kingdom which specialises in four-wheel-drive vehicles. It is part of the Jaguar Land Rover group, a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India. It is the second oldest four-wheel-drive car brand in the world. The Land Rover name was originally used by the Rover Company for one specific vehicle model, named simply the Land Rover, launched by Rover in 1948. Over the following years it developed into a marque encompassing a range of four-wheel-drive models, including the Defender, Discovery, Freelander, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Range Rover Evoque. Land Rovers are currently assembled in the company's Halewood and Solihull plants, with research and development taking place at JLR's Gaydon and Whitley engineering centres. Land Rover sold 194,000 vehicles worldwide in 2009. Although the brand originates from the original 1948 model, Land Rover as a company has only existed since 1978. Prior to this, it was a product line of the Rover Company which was subsequently absorbed into the Rover-Triumph division of the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BL) following Leyland Motor Corporation\u2019s takeover of Rover in 1967. The ongoing commercial success of the original Land Rover series models, and latterly the Range Rover in the 1970s in the midst of BL\u2019s well documented business troubles prompted the establishment of a separate Land Rover company but still under the BL umbrella, remaining part of the subsequent Rover Group in 1988, under the ownership of British Aerospace after the remains of British Leyland were broken up and privatised. In 1994 Rover Group plc was acquired by BMW. In 2000, Rover Group was broken-up by BMW and Land Rover was sold to Ford Motor Company, becoming part of its Premier Automotive Group. In 2006 Ford purchased the Rover brand from BMW for around \u00A36 million. This reunited the Rover and Land Rover brands for the first time since 2000 when the Rover group was broken up by BMW. In June 2008, Ford sold both Land Rover and Jaguar Cars to Tata Motors. This sale also included the dormant Rover brand"@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_East_India_Company>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"The Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, VOC, \"United East India Company\") was a chartered company established in 1602, when the States-General of the Netherlands granted it a 21-year monopoly to carry out colonial activities in Asia. It is often considered to have been the first multinational corporation in the world and it was the first company to issue stock. It was also arguably the first megacorporation, possessing quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, coin money, and establish colonies. Statistically, the VOC eclipsed all of its rivals in the Asia trade. Between 1602 and 1796 the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships, and netted for their efforts more than 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. By contrast, the rest of Europe combined sent only 882,412 people from 1500 to 1795, and the fleet of the English East India Company, the VOC\u2019s nearest competitor, was a distant second to its total traffic with 2,690 ships and a mere one-fifth the tonnage of goods carried by the VOC. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century. Having been set up in 1602, to profit from the Malukan spice trade, in 1619 the VOC established a capital in the port city of Batavia. Over the next two centuries the Company acquired additional ports as trading bases and safeguarded their interests by taking over surrounding territory. It remained an important trading concern and paid an 18% annual dividend for almost 200 years. Weighed down by corruption in the late 18th century, the Company went bankrupt and was formally dissolved in 1800, its possessions and the debt being taken over by the government of the Dutch Batavian Republic. The VOC's territories became the Dutch East Indies and were expanded over the course of the 19th century to include the whole of the Indonesian archipelago, and in the 20th century would form the Republic of Indonesia. The tulip mania in 1637, driving up the value of tulip bulbs by rampant speculation, made The Dutch East India Company the most valuable company in world history. With a value of 78 million Dutch Guilders, adjusted to 2012 dollars it was worth $7.4 trillion."@en .

In 1958, engineer and skier Ed Scott from Sun Valley, Idaho invented a ski pole made of aluminium, which compared favorably to those made of bamboo or steel. On the basis of this success, the company started to produce many kinds of sports goods. In 1970, Scott sold their first protection goggles for motocross riders; further motocross wear followed. Scott expanded to Europe in 1978, settling their headquarters in Fribourg, Switzerland. In 1989, SCOTT introduced one of the most significant product innovations in the history of cycling - the clip-on aerodynamic handlebar. The handlebar was strategically utilized by American Greg Lemond in his 1989 Tour de France win, when he beat Frenchman Laurent Fignon by nearly a minute in the 24.5km final time trial. In 1991, Scott produced the first suspension fork named \"Unishock\" and a year later, the first full suspension mountain bike was shown to the public. The racing bicycle sector expanded continuously and in 2002, stage 10 of the Tour de France was won by Patrice Halgand riding for the Jean Delatour team, which was at that time supported by Scott. Today, Scott supplies GreenEDGE Cycling with equipment. The name 'Scott USA' was changed to 'Scott Sports', representing a shift in emphasis to the European market."@en .

The joint venture produces small cars under licence from Fiat and Brilliance China Auto, a pick-up truck and an SUV using complete knock down kits from Chinese manufacturer Dandong Shuguang, a Mercedes-Benz/SsangYong design luxury cars. Pyeonghwa has the exclusive rights to car production, purchase, and sale of used cars in North Korea. However, most North Koreans are unable to afford a car. Because of the very small market for cars in the country, Pyeonghwa's output is reportedly very low. In 2003, only 314 cars were produced even though the factory had the facilities to produce up to 10,000 cars a year. Erik van Ingen Schenau, author of the book Automobiles Made in North Korea, has estimated the company's total production in 2005 at not more than around 400 units."@en .

Colt is best known for the engineering, production, and marketing of firearms over the later half of the 19th and the 20th century. Colt's earliest designs played a major role in the popularization of the revolver and the shift away from earlier single-shot pistols. While Sam Colt did not invent the revolver concept, his designs resulted in the first very successful ones. The most famous Colt products include the Colt Walker, Single Action Army or Peacemaker, and the Colt Python. John Browning worked for Colt for a time, and came up with a design for a semiautomatic pistol, which debuted as the Colt M1900 pistol and eventually evolved into the Colt M1911 pistol. Though they did not develop it, for a long time Colt was primarily responsible for all AR-15 and M16 rifle production, as well as many derivatives of those firearms. The most successful and famous of these are numerous M16 carbines, including the Colt Commando family, and the M4 carbine. In 2002, Colt Defense was split off from Colt's Manufacturing Company. Colt Manufacturing Company now serves the civilian market, while Colt Defense serves the law enforcement, military, and private security markets worldwide."@en .

On 2 July 2012 all of British Waterways' assets and responsibilities in England and Wales were transferred to the newly founded charity the Canal & River Trust. In Scotland British Waterways continues to operate as a standalone public corporation under the trading name Scottish Canals. The British Waterways Board was initially established as a result of the Transport Act 1962 and took control of the inland waterways assets of the British Transport Commission in 1963. British Waterways was sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in England and Wales, and by the Scottish Government in Scotland. British Waterways managed and maintained 2,200 miles of canals, rivers and docks within the United Kingdom including the buildings, structures and landscapes alongside these waterways. Due to the size of the canal network controlled, half of the United Kingdom population lives within five miles of a canal or river once managed by British Waterways. In additional to the watercourses, British Waterways also cared for and owned 2,555 listed structures including 70 Scheduled Ancient Monuments. A further 800 areas have special designation and a further 100 are Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). Through its charitable arm The Waterways Trust, British Waterways maintained a museum of its history within the National Waterways Museum's three sites at Gloucester Docks, Stoke Bruerne and Ellesmere Port. Since the transfer of the assets and responsibilities of British Waterways to the Canal & River Trust the Waterways Trust in England and Wales has merged with the Canal & River Trust.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citigroup>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Citigroup Inc. or Citi is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States. Citigroup was formed from one of the world's largest mergers in history by combining the banking giant Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group in October 1998 (announced on April 7, 1998). The year 2012 marks Citi's 200th anniversary. It is currently the third largest bank holding company in the United States by assets. Citigroup has the world's largest financial services network, spanning 140 countries with approximately 16,000 offices worldwide. The company currently employs approximately 260,000 staff around the world, which is down from 267,150 in 2010, according to Forbes. It also holds over 200\u00A0million customer accounts in more than 140 countries. It is a primary dealers in US Treasury securities. According to Forbes, at its height Citigroup used to be the largest company and bank in the world by total assets with 357,000 employees until the global financial crisis of 2008. Today it is ranked 20th in size under the Fortune 500 list. In comparison, JPMorgan Chase, which is ranked 16th on the Fortune 500, is now the largest bank in U.S. as of 2012. Citigroup suffered huge losses during the global financial crisis of 2008 and was rescued in November 2008 in a massive stimulus package by the U.S. government. Its largest shareholders include funds from the Middle East and Singapore. On February 27, 2009, Citigroup announced that the United States government would take a 36% equity stake in the company by converting US$25\u00A0billion in emergency aid into common shares with a US Treasury credit line of $45\u00A0billion to prevent the bankruptcy of the largest bank in the world at the time. The government would also guarantee losses on more than $300\u00A0billion troubled assets and inject $20\u00A0billion immediately into the company. In exchange, the salary of the CEO is $1 per year and the highest salary of employees is restricted to $500,000 in cash and any amount above $500,000 must be paid with restricted stock that cannot be sold until the emergency government aid is repaid in full. The US government also gains control of half the seats in the Board of Directors, and the senior management is subjected to removal by the US government if there is poor performance. By December 2009, the US government stake was reduced to 27% majority stake from a 36% majority stake after Citigroup sold $21\u00A0billion of common shares and equity in the largest single share sale in US history, surpassing Bank of America's $19\u00A0billion share sale one month prior. Eventually by December 2010, Citigroup repaid the emergency aid in full and the US government received an additional $12\u00A0billion profit in selling its shares. US Government restrictions on pay and oversight of the senior management were removed after the US government sold its remaining 27% stake as of December 2010. Despite huge losses during the global financial crisis, Citigroup built up an enormous cash reserve in the wake of the financial crisis with $420\u00A0billion in surplus liquid cash and government securities as of June 2012. As of Q1 2012, Citi has tier 1 capital ratio of 12.4%, making one of the best-capitalized financial institutions in the world after billions of dollars in losses from the financial crisis. This was a result of selling more than $500\u00A0billion of its special assets placed in Citi Holdings, which were guaranteed from losses by the US Treasury while under federal majority ownership. Additionally, according to the Washington Post, a special IRS tax exception given to Citi to allow the US Treasury to sell its shares at a profit while it still owned Citigroup shares, which eventually netted $12\u00A0billion. According to Treasury spokeswoman Nayyera Haq, \"This (IRS tax) rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes, and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation where the government owned shares in banks. And it was certainly not written to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit. \" Citigroup is one of the Big Four banks in the United States, along with Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo."@en .

Budweiser Bier Lager Budweiser Bier or Budweiser B\u00FCrgerbr\u00E4u was (since 1802 and as trademark officially since 1899) the name for the beer and the administration of the \"B\u00FCrgerliches Brauhaus Budweis\" (German for \"Civic Brewhouse Budweis\"), which in 1795 was founded by the German-speaking burghers of the Bohemian city of Budweis in the Kingdom of Bohemia). In 1894, the official company name was \"Die Budweiser Br\u00E4uberechtigten - B\u00FCrgerliches Br\u00E4uhaus-Gegr\u00FCndet 1795 - Budweis\". As early as 1875, beer was being exported to the United States where Budweiser was already being copied by local brewers like Anheuser-Busch. In 1895, when Budweiser B\u00FCrgerbr\u00E4u became official court supplier to the King of W\u00FCrttemberg, the growing Czech population founded local competition as a joint stock company, today called Bud\u011Bjovick\u00FD Budvar. In the Budweiser trademark dispute, the three companies divided the rights to use the name, with the Europe-based companies giving up the Northern American rights to Budweiser. Bohemia constituted part of the new Republic of Czechoslovakia founded following the breakup of the Habsburg Empire at the end of World War I in 1918. In 1945, all Germans were expelled and both breweries expropriated. The German-sounding names of the B\u00FCrgerbr\u00E4u company and its products were not welcome, and all rights had to be dropped or were otherwise lost, with beer being sold as \"Crystal\" or \"Samson\". Accordingly in 1960 and 1989 the company was renamed, to \"Prvn\u00ED bud\u011Bjovick\u00FD pivovar Samson\" (First Budweiser brewery Samson). After the fall of communism, the company owned rights to \"Crystal\", \"Czech Beer Crystal\", \"Biere Tcheque Crystal\" and \"Samson\", but soon reacquired national naming rights and international Protected Geographical Indication, in 1991 to \"Bud\u011Bjovick\u00FD m\u011B\u0161\u0165ansk\u00FD var\" and \"Budweiser B\u00FCrgerbr\u00E4u\", and in 1993 to \"Bud\u011Bjovick\u00E9 pivo\", \"Budweiser Bier\", \"Biere de Budweis\" and \"Budweis Beer\". Since July 2001 the company is called Bud\u011Bjovick\u00FD m\u011B\u0161\u0165ansk\u00FD pivovar a.s. (Budweiser citizens brewery), which corresponds to the original German name. The company uses German naming like \"Budweiser Bier\" also in Czech and English context, also stating that the hops comes from the \"Czech city of Saaz (Zatec)\" despite this city also has an old Czech name. Since 2005, due to the legal situation, the brewery offers its beer in the USA as \"B.B. B\u00FCrgerbr\u00E4u - since 1795\", described as \"Budweis City Bier\" rather than \"Budweiser beer\"."@en .

Sprint Nextel, through its various subsidiaries, also offers wireless services under the Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless brands. Sprint Nextel is a tier 1 global Internet access service provider. Sprint Nextel is the United States' third largest long distance provider by subscribers. Sprint Nextel derives additional revenue by offering wholesale access to its wireless networks. As of 2012, the Sprint wireless network serves more than 55.6 million customers. Sprint Nextel traces its origins to the Brown Telephone Company, which Cleyson L. (C.L. ) Brown and Jacob Brown founded in 1899 to deploy telephone service to the rural area around Abilene, KS. Prior to 2005, the company was known as Sprint Corporation. The company took its current name, \"Sprint Nextel Corporation\", when it merged with Nextel Communications that year. In 2006, Sprint Nextel exited the local landline telephone business, spinning those assets off into a newly created company named Embarq, which CenturyTel subsequently acquired in 2008. Sprint Nextel owns a 50.8% equity interest in Clearwire Corporation. On December 17, 2012, Sprint Nextel agreed to pay US$2.97 per share, US$2.2 billion in total, to purchase the portion of Clearwire Corporation shares that Sprint Nextel does not already own. On October 14, 2012, Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank announced that it intends to purchase 70% of Sprint Nextel Corporation for US$20.1 billion. The companies expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2013. Sprint Nextel is headquartered in Overland Park, Kansas, United States and is led by Dan Hesse, the President and C.E.O."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foursquare>	<http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>	"Foursquare is a location-based social networking website for mobile devices, such as smartphones. Users \"check in\" at venues using a mobile website, text messaging or a device-specific application by selecting from a list of venues the application locates nearby. Location is based on GPS hardware in the mobile device or network location provided by the application. Each check-in awards the user points and sometimes \"badges\". The service was created in 2009 by Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai. Crowley had previously founded the similar project Dodgeball as his graduate thesis project in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at New York University. Google bought Dodgeball in 2005 and shut it down in 2009, replacing it with Google Latitude. Dodgeball user interactions were based on SMS technology, rather than an application. Foursquare is the second iteration of the same idea, that people can use mobile devices to interact with their environment. As of April 2012, the company reported it had 20 million registered users. The company was expected to pass 750 million check-ins before the end of June 2011, with an average of about 3 million check-ins per day. Male and female users are equally represented and also 50 percent of users are outside the US. Support for French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Japanese was added in February 2011. Support for Indonesian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Thai was added in September 2011. Support for Turkish was added in June 2012."@en .

A division of Tenchstar, Ltd. MetaComCo's first product was an MBASIC compatible interpreter for IBM PC's, which was licensed by Peter Mackeonis to Digital Research in 1982, and issued as the Digital Research Personal Basic, or PBASIC, running under CP/M. Other computer languages followed, also licensed by Digital Research and MetaComCo established an office in Pacific Grove, California, to service their USA customers. In 1984 Dr. Tim King joined the company, bringing with him a version of the operating system TRIPOS for the Motorola 68000 processor which he had previously worked on whilst a researcher at the University of Cambridge. This operating system was used as the basis of AmigaDOS (file-related functions of AmigaOS); MetaComCo won the contract from Commodore because the original planned Amiga disk operating system called Commodore Amiga Operating System (CAOS) was behind schedule; timescales were incredibly tight and TRIPOS provided a head start for a replacement system. MetaComCo also developed ABasiC for the Amiga which was initially provided with Amigas. Much to Commodore's annoyance MetaComCo also worked with Atari to produce the BASIC that was initially provided with the Atari ST \u2014 ST BASIC. The company also sold the Lattice C compiler for the Sinclair QL and the Atari ST and range of other languages (e.g. Pascal, BCPL) for m68k-based computers. MetaComCo also represented LISP and REDUCE software from the RAND Corporation. Several of the team at MetaComCo went on to found Perihelion Software. Mackeonis founded Triangle Publishing, the software publishing company responsible for creating the ST Organizer for the Atari ST and PC Organizer and Counterpoint for Amstrad Computers and GoldStar computers."@en .

DIC is located adjacent to other industrial clusters such as Dubai Media City and Dubai Knowledge Village.
